Two days after my grandfather died, the neighborhood security guard knocks on our door on a Sunday morning.

He told us: ‘An old man came to your house earlier, knocked on your door for half an hour, and finally left.

When I asked him what he wanted, he told me he needed to say goodbye to someone he had never had the chance to meet.’ We were all stunned, had no idea who this old man was, or who was he looking for.

When the guard came in, he shouted: ‘That’s the old man!!’ pointing at a picture of my grandfather. My entire family froze for a minute.

I’m not 100% sure if the guard was telling the truth, but I almost like believing that my grandad wanted to say goodbye to my newborn sister, before resting in peace.
